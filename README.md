csle, short for "Chinese String Literal Expression", inspect whether the string literal expression contains Chinese characters, and can quickly fix them between simplified or traditional glyphs.

If you don't want to inspect the strings in certain locations, such as: print, you can exclude them in the settings.

In the plugin settings view, you can modify the Chinese glyphs you want to inspect and the glyphs to quick fix.
