Good news, this plugin supports Dart/Java/Kotlin/JavaScript/TypeScript, no need to install multiple anymore. You can uninstall the old plugin and then install this one.

Inspect whether the string literal expression of the Dart/Java/Kotlin/JavaScript/TypeScript language contains Chinese characters, and can quickly fix them between simplified or traditional characters.

If you don't want to inspect the strings in certain locations, such as: print, you can exclude them in the settings.

In the plugin settings view, you can modify the Chinese glyphs you want to inspect and the glyphs to quick fix.
